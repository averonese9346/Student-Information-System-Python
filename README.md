# Student-Information-System-Python
This is a Python program I created for one of my courses that is a student information system. You can follow the prompts to add, edit, and remove students. 

These students have the following fields that can be managed:
- Name
- Phone Number
- ID Number
- Major

You are also able to use the prompts to query for the information of a specific student as needed.

Enjoy!
